Task-1 and Task-2
This repository features two AI-powered interactive systems designed to enable seamless querying and interaction with data:

Chat with PDF:
This feature employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to allow users to upload PDF files and interact with their content through natural language queries. The system extracts and indexes semi-structured data, enabling users to perform efficient queries and comparisons with high accuracy.

Key functionalities include PDF text extraction, logical chunking for better granularity, embedding generation using pre-trained NLP models, vector-based similarity search for precise data retrieval, and response generation using a Large Language Model (LLM). Additionally, it supports comparison queries and provides structured responses such as tables or bullet points.


Chat with Website:
This feature enables users to interact with content from a website by scraping, indexing, and querying the data through a chatbot interface. It is ideal for efficiently querying FAQs, blogs, or any structured web content.

Key functionalities include web content scraping and ingestion, text cleaning and preprocessing, embedding generation and storage for fast retrieval, and natural language interaction powered by an LLM. The system is designed to provide accurate and contextual responses, leveraging AI and modern NLP technologies.

Both tasks demonstrate the integration of advanced AI techniques and natural language processing to create robust and intuitive systems for interacting with unstructured and semi-structured data.
